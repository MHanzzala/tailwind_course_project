what are utility classes and their advantage? 
----------------------------------------------------
Utility classes are a set of CSS classes that provide a single specific styling property or a combination of properties. These classes are designed to be small and reusable, and they can be combined to create complex and custom designs with minimal CSS code.

The advantages of using utility classes in web development include:

Reusability: Utility classes can be reused across multiple elements, making it easier to maintain consistency throughout a website or web application.

Flexibility: Utility classes can be combined and customized to create unique styles that fit specific design requirements.

Consistency: Utility classes provide a standardized set of styles that can be used throughout a project, ensuring consistent styling across all elements.

Easy to Learn and Use: Utility classes have a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn and use, even for beginners.

Reduced Code Bloat: Because utility classes are small and targeted, they can help reduce the amount of CSS code needed to style a web page, resulting in faster load times and a more efficient codebase.

Overall, using utility classes in web development can help developers create consistent, flexible, and efficient designs that are easier to maintain and update over time.
